Find Acronyms Quickly (FAQ) is a simple firefox extension that lets you look up acronyms or abbreviations by selecting them with your cursor and right clicking. A "Search acronym" button will appear in a context menu, once clicked it opens the acronym on <a href="https://www.allacronyms.com/">allacronyms.com</a>
